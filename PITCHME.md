#### What is an EMP?
* An electromagnetic pulse (EMP), also sometimes called a transient electromagnetic disturbance, is a short burst of electromagnetic energy. Such a pulse's origination may be a natural occurrence or man-made and can occur as a radiated, electric, or magnetic field or a conducted electric current, depending on the source. -**Wikipedia**

- 900 miles off the coast of Hawaii
- Altitude of 250 miles
- 10 degrees above Horizon in Honolulu
- Accurate to expected yield of 1.4 to 1.45 megatons (~15xHiroshima)
- EMP Yield was many times expectation

- So large, that it could not be measured by much of the test equipment
- Knocked out 300 streetlight 898 miles away
- Disabled telephone service to Kauai
- Bright auroras visible from 21 degrees S to 23 Degrees north for 90 minutes
- Eventually disabled a third of all satellites in operation

- Low yield weapon
- Not tuned for max EMP 
- Unintentional
